## Solution

The solution is very simple. 
Just go the different direction than that Lydia took.

### Complexity

O(N), because we have to examine every move of Lydia.

## Experience

I started with a more complex solution, that wanted to go alternating, considering Lydia's path.
It wasn't that complex, but the final solution is much simpler.
